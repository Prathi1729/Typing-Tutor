"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." - Winston Churchill. 
Success and failure are not permanent states, but rather fleeting moments in a lifelong journey. 
What truly matters is having the courage to keep going, to persist in the face of challenges and setbacks, 
and to learn and grow from both our successes and our failures. It is this resilience and determination that ultimately lead to 
true success and fulfillment in life.
