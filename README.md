# Typing-Tutor
Typing tutor is a command driven application that help users to perfect their typing skills. It allows users to take typing skills. It allows user to take typing tests and determine their typing speed and accuracy.


Boyer Moore Algorithm:
	The Boyer Moore algorithm is considered as the most efficient string matching algorithm in all application. A simplified version of it or the entire algorithm is often implemented in text editors for search and substitute commands

Naïve Algorithm:
	The Naïve is String matching algorithm. It behaves in simple way. The naïve approach tests all the possible placements of Pattern P[1….m] relative to text T[1….n]. We try shifts s=0,1….n-m, successively and for each shift s. Compare T[s+1….S+m] to P[1….m].
