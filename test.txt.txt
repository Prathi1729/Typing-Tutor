One of the most fascinating and little-known facts about the universe is that over 95% of it is made up of mysterious, invisible 
substances known as dark matter and dark energy. While we can't directly observe or detect these substances, scientists have inferred 
their existence from the gravitational effects they have on visible matter. In fact, without dark matter and dark energy, our universe 
would look very different, and the galaxies we see today would not be able to form or remain stable. Understanding these mysterious 
substances is one of the biggest challenges in modern astrophysics, and may hold the key to unlocking some of the deepest mysteries of 
the cosmos.
